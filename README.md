# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Classifier-
This repository contains a sentiment classifier for movie reviews built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project uses the NLTK Movie Reviews Dataset to classify reviews as positive or negative, with the following key features:

Project Features:
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, POS tagging, and punctuation removal.
Feature Engineering: Utilizes frequency distribution of common words and custom feature dictionaries for sentiment classification.
Model Training & Evaluation: Implements Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers, evaluates accuracy, and visualizes the most informative features.
Results Analysis: Shows model accuracy and top-performing features for insights into classification results.
How to Use:
Setup: Download necessary NLTK resources (movie_reviews, stopwords, averaged_perceptron_tagger, wordnet).
Run the Code: Execute the provided script to preprocess the data, train models, and output classification accuracy.
Analyze Results: Use output from the script to assess model accuracy and visualize key features.
This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand sentiment analysis in NLP and gain experience with data preprocessing and classification in Python.

Tech Stack:
Languages: Python
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-Learn
Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
